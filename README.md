# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based visualization tool for various sorting algorithms. It allows you to visually understand how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process in real-time.

## Features
- Generate random arrays for visualization
- Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort
- Interactive controls to initiate sorting and generate new arrays
- Smooth animations to demonstrate the sorting process
- Responsive and user-friendly design

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Open the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in a web browser.
2. Click "Generate Array" to create a random array.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm to visualize (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort).
4. Click the respective sorting algorithm button to start the visualization.
5. Observe the bars representing the array being sorted in real-time.
6. Use the "Generate Array" button to generate new arrays for visualization.
